# Webhooks

With Nusii webhooks we can send your application requests when something interesting happens, like `Proposal Accepted`, `Proposal Viewed` etc. 

## Webhook endpoint format

Every webhook uses the same structure. It will always be in a standard `POST` request with the object in the body.

The target url needs to be able to accept `Content Type`: `application/json` and `POST` requests. Everything other than a 2xx request will be concidered an error and we will try will retry 25 times. If we receive a `410 GONE` response, we will delete the webhook entirely. 

Parameter | Description
--------- | ------- 
event_name | The name of the event. `proposal_created`, `client_updated` etc. 
The object | An hash that represents the object. The key is always the name of the object. "proposal", "client" etc

```json
  {
    "event_name": "proposal_created",
    "proposal": {
      "id": 30,
      "title": "Webdevelopment",
      ...
    }
  }
```

## Webhook endpoint errors

We concider all responses with `2xx` as successful. Other than that we concider it as an error and we will retry the request 24 times. If we receive a `410 GONE`, the enpoint will get removed from our database.

## Available webhooks
